    <h2><div class="p3"></div>What's your opinion on chat GPT and its ability to limit the human thinking capacity?</h2>
    <h3><div class="p4"></div>The quality of conversation between human and AI / Chat GPT, depends on the intelligence of the human conversational partner, such that, if ten separate individuals of graduated intelligence, from low, to extremely high, were to each open up a conversation with AI / Chat GPT on the same subject, the quality of the outcome of their conversation will differ and correlate positively with knowledge and IQ. Extreme curiosity, high turn of speed and capacity for analytical thinking, fact checking of received information, storage/retention, organisation and mapping of received information in the context of one's compendium of knowledge, exponential internal discovery of new knowledge from hitherto unknown connections of the new information received, to the information already resident in one's memory, capacity for generation of new deeply searching and insightful questions, imaginative statements and assertions founded in novel extensions of knowledge, challenges to AI/Chat GPT, that move the conversation to higher and higher planes, till the zenith of what is discernible and mutually comprehensible in the conversation between machine and human is reached, are all contributors to the quality of human: AI interaction.</h3>
